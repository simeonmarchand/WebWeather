# Web Weather App

The Web Weather App is a personal project designed to showcase my skills in JavaScript and npm. This application allows users to get real-time weather updates for any location around the globe. By simply entering the name of a city, users can view the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions. The application features a clean, user-friendly interface and is responsive for use on both desktop and mobile devices. This project serves as a practical application of API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive web design.

This is going to be added to my portfolio for future employers to see.
